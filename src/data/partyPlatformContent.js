        text: `“A Strong Russia — United Russia” Our Nation’s history is defined by monumental struggles and heroic revival—from repelling foreign invasions to overcoming the devastation of the 1990s.
In 2003, Russia has entered a new turning point. The Russian people no longer endure chaos, corruption, and instability—they yearn for unity, leadership, and national dignity.
Formed in March 2003 through the merger of Unity and Fatherland–All Russia, United Russia emerged to lead Russia toward sovereignty, prosperity, and social cohesion.
Under leaders like Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov and regional governor allies, we are the party of real results, the stability-first movement building on President Putin’s vision.
In the December 7, 2003 State Duma election, United Russia won 37.56% of the party-list vote and secured 223 out of 450 seats, becoming the dominant political force in the legislature.
Voter turnout stood at 55.75%, a clear call for responsible, responsive governance.
We present this platform: a practical, centrist, and socially conscious roadmap for a stable and unified Russia.
We reject extremes of ideology in favor of a pragmatic conservatism rooted in Russian historical traditions, statism, and patriotic values.`
